## About the Project

This Random Pokémon Generator was created as a final project to an NYU SPS front-end web development course, using the data from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

Click on the green "Get Random Pokémon" button to generate stats about a random Pokémon. Stats include height, weight, type(s), abilities, and evolution chain. Hover over the abilities to see the description of the abilities.
